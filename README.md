# CosmosRapidStart

CostmosRapidStart was created as a simple way to whip up a proof of concept project quickly, without having to spend a bunch of time thinking about the data layer.

Sometimes, you need to have a functioning POC, using persisted data. CosmosRapidStart is my way of getting a functional and interactive app for shareholders, partners, and teammembers quickly, an not having to spend a lot of time thinking about the data layer that is bound to change sever times.
